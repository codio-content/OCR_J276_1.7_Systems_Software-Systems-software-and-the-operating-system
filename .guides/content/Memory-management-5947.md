The memory manager is in charge of the RAM which programs need to use when they are running.

In a computer system many programs are running at the same time (multitasking).

Some programs are large complex and will need to use the RAM extensively whereas some very small programs wonâ€™t need to use it much. 

The memory manager of the operating system checks that all requests from programs for memory space are valid, priorities them and allocates RAM accordingly. 

It will also de-allocate space and swaps out data to the swap file of the virtual memory.(See Module 1.2 Memory).
