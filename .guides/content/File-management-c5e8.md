The file manager of the operating system provides an interface between the user and computer files e.g. text, graphic and program files. 

It creates the illusion that files and folders actually exist. To a computer they don’t. There are only blocks of memory containing data. The file manager tracks items of data and links them to file names and folders created by the user.

The file manager presents the stored data to the user in a form that they can understand – as files within folders.

The file manager also controls file permissions such as a user’s ability to carry out the following operations:

- view 
- open 
- edit 
- rename
- delete 

It is therefore important for the security of the system.
