Users interact with the operating system through a **user interface**.

Many operating system provide a graphical user interface (GUI) e.g. Windows and iOS. The user communicates with the operating system using **W**indows, **I**cons, drop-down **M**enus and **P**ointers (WIMP).

Before GUIs all operating systems provided a **command line interface** â€“ where the user has to type in commands for the operating system e.g. to print, copy, delete and move files.
These were less convenient as the user had to learn all of the commands e.g. to print, copy and move files.
